## [0.0.178.0] - 2026-05-13 — fix: PromoteToVoter orphan recovery in Raft v2 becomeLeader

### Fixed

- **`recoverOrphanedPromote()`** added to `internal/raft/membership.go`, called from
  `becomeLeader()` after `recoverInFlightJoint()`. Handles the crash scenario where the
  prior leader committed Stage-1 (`ConfChangePromoteStage1` — drops target from learners)
  but crashed before appending Stage-2 (`LogEntryJointConfChange`). The orphaned target
  is left in neither voters nor learners, blocking it from participating in consensus.
- Recovery synthesises `pendingSingleConf` (pointing to the Stage-1 log index) and
  `pendingPromote` so the existing `advanceSingleConfPhase` machinery dispatches Stage-2
  on the new leader. When Stage-1 is already committed at `becomeLeader` time the call
  is driven inline; otherwise `applyCommitted → advanceSingleConfPhase` fires it.
- `matchIndex`/`nextIndex` for the orphaned target is seeded to
  `(0, lastLogIndex+1)` when absent — the normal path seeds these when the target joins
  as a learner, but `becomeLeader` skips it since the target is no longer in
  `currentConfig.learners` after Stage-1.

### Notes

- **MetaRaft.Join operator action**: `recoverOrphanedPromote` completes the Raft membership
  promotion but `ProposeAddNode` (the `MetaNodeEntry` write that follows `PromoteToVoter`
  in `MetaRaft.Join`) never ran on the crashed leader. After recovery, the operator must
  re-issue `Join` for the orphaned target to register it in the meta-Raft node table.

### Verification

- `go test -race ./internal/raft/ -run TestPromoteToVoter_OrphanRecovery -count=20` — all PASS
- `go test ./internal/raft/ -timeout 120s -count=1` — all PASS (63 s, 63 tests)

## [0.0.177.0] - 2026-05-13 — fix: RouteObjectWrite preserves forward peers when self is leader

### Fixed

- `OpRouter.RouteObjectWrite` now populates `RouteTarget.Peers` even when
  `SelfIsLeader` is true. Previously, `routeGroup` short-circuited and left
  `Peers` empty, so if leadership changed between routing and execution the
  write had no forward candidates. `RouteBucket` still uses the short-circuit
  path (peers empty on leader) — only the object-write path resolves peers.

### Verification

- `go test -count=3 ./internal/cluster/ -run TestOpRouter_Route` — all PASS
- `go test -count=1 ./internal/cluster/` — all PASS

## [0.0.176.0] - 2026-05-13 — feat: SendTimeoutNow QUIC RPC (leader transfer)

### Added

- `SetTimeoutNowTransport` on `RaftNode` interface and `raftNodeAdapter`/`raftTransportBridge`;
  uses `atomic.Pointer[timeoutNowFn]` for lock-free late binding. Returns `ErrNotImplemented`
  when not wired (nil pointer), same fallback contract as `SendInstallSnapshot`.
- `sendTimeoutNow` + `SetTimeoutNowTransport` on `RaftQUICRPCTransport`; wire format is
  byte-identical to the v1 QUIC codec using a new `v2RPCTypeTimeoutNow` message type.
- `v2RPCTransport.SetTimeoutNowTransport()` call in `serveruntime.Run`; logged as
  "raft v2: QUIC RPC transport wired (TimeoutNow enabled)".

### Fixed

- `TransferLeadership` (Raft §3.10) now works end-to-end over QUIC in multi-node v2 clusters.
  Previously `SendTimeoutNow` returned `ErrNotImplemented`, causing the transfer target to miss
  the TimeoutNow signal and rely on the natural [T, 2T) election window instead.

### Verification

- `go build ./...`
- `go test ./internal/cluster/ -run TestSendTimeoutNow` (unit: ErrNotImplemented when unwired)
- `go test ./internal/cluster/ -run TestSetTimeoutNowTransport` (unit: nil-bridge no-panic)
- `go test ./internal/cluster/ -run TestV2QUICCluster_ThreeNode_TransferLeadership -count=5`
  with ET=5s discriminator: new leader appears within 2s, proving TimeoutNow fired.

## [0.0.175.0] - 2026-05-13 — fix: eliminate peerHealth race in ecObjectReader goroutine drain

### Fixed

- Moved `peerHealth.MarkHealthy`/`MarkUnhealthy` calls from spawned shard-fetch
  goroutines to the main goroutine in `ecObjectReader.readShards`. Previously,
  k-of-n early exit could leave a goroutine still executing `MarkUnhealthy` while
  the caller already read `health.unhealthy`, producing a DATA RACE under
  `-race`. The fix encodes peer state (`peer`, `peerOK`, `canceled`) in
  `shardResult` and processes it in `applyShardResult` and the drain loop —
  both running on the single main goroutine.

### Verification

- `go test -race -count=100 ./internal/cluster/ -run TestECObjectReader_ReadObject_MarksUnhealthyPeerOnFetchError` — 100/100 PASS, 0 DATA RACE
- `go test -race -count=100 ./internal/cluster/ -run TestECObjectReader_ReadObject_MarksHealthyPeerOnSuccess` — 100/100 PASS, 0 DATA RACE
