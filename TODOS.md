## Follow-ups

### Bucket-delete config cascade follow-ups (PR: fix-bucket-delete-config-cascade)

- **[P3][won't-fix] Mixed `--lifecycle-interval` clusters are unsupported.** The lifecycle-delete
  cascade is gated per-node on `LifecycleInterval > 0`, which is **load-bearing**, not cosmetic: the
  lifecycle store itself is only wired when `interval > 0` (`boot_phases_srvopts.go`), and
  `applyBucketLifecycleDelete` errors if the store is nil (`meta_fsm_lifecycle.go`). So a deliberately
  mixed cluster (some nodes `0`, some `>0`) is operator misconfiguration, not a latent bug. Uniform
  deployments unaffected.

### Bucket config off group-0 (control-plane read linearization)

- **[DONE] Follower-stale bucket-versioning read at the mutating S3 edge.** A multipart-complete / PUT /
  Copy on a group-0 follower read its lagging local replica and silently wrote the object
  non-versioned (a just-joined follower observed Unversioned for ~90s after another node enabled
  versioning). Fixed: the mutating edge resolves versioning via a linearizing read
  (`GetBucketVersioningLinearized` = ReadIndex+WaitApplied, reusing the object-read primitive),
  **degrading to a local read during a group-0 leaderless window** so writes aren't coupled to
  control-plane leadership; reads/scrub keep the plain local read. Versioning stays on group-0 raft
  (consensus preserved — a mutable RMW cell needs total order + atomic CAS, which a quorum LWW blob
  can't provide; see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-bucket-config-off-group0-quorum-design.md`).
- **[P3][follow-up] Linearize `GetBucketPolicy` the same way** — identical plain-`store.View` shape on
  group-0; a stale policy read at a mutating edge could mis-authorize. Small, reuses the same pattern.
- **[P3][follow-up] AppendObject versioned-bucket feature-gate** reads versioning via the PLAIN read
  (`object_append.go`), so a stale follower read can let an append proceed on a versioning-enabled
  bucket (a 501-gate bypass, not data mis-versioning). Pre-existing; route through the linearized read
  if it matters.
- **[P3][epic, separate] group-0 control-plane demotion** — consolidate bucket existence/assignment
  onto the true meta-raft (`bucketAssignments`) so group-0 becomes a plain data group. Larger; touches
  bucket-lifecycle atomicity + the #838 delete cascade. Not needed for the read-linearization fix.

### Tests / docs / spec polish

- **[P3][test] Deterministic multi-node reproduction of the forwarded-propose apply-wait + MPU
  phantom-winner guard.** The follower-stale-versioning blocker is now fixed (above), so a follower
  CAN do a versioned write (`tests/e2e/cluster_versioned_write_follower_test.go`, a happy-path
  integration spec). A *deterministic* reproduction of the phantom-winner race still needs a group-0 /
  data-group apply-delay seam (a long-enough delay collides with the 30s propose deadline — the trap
  that blocked the earlier attempt). The guard logic is unit-covered (`readDoneMarkerFn` seam);
  add the deterministic e2e if an apply-timing seam is introduced.

## Superseded / historical (do not resurrect the analysis)

The blob-authoritative pivot (#821–#825: greenfield raft-free data plane + soleauth-machinery removal)
obsoleted the following. Their detailed roadmaps/architecture notes were removed because carrying false
analysis forward is a trap:
- **[EPIC] Per-version quorum-meta foundation** (S4b PR-B / S4c cutover / S5) — the end-state shipped via
  the greenfield route; the staged cutover + verifier + soleauth flip it was gated on were removed.
- **[EPIC] Retroactive EC-redundancy upgrade for NON-LATEST versions** — premise dead: per-version
  metadata is now a K-of-N replicated blob, not a generation-sharded FSM record, so the cross-group
  record migration it described no longer exists. Any residual non-redundant-genesis-DATA gap, if real,
  needs a fresh spec.
- **DeleteObjectVersion stale-latest quorum-meta pointer** — DONE-IN-EFFECT: hard delete now writes a
  durable `IsHardDeleted` tombstone (LWW `MetaSeq+1`) and versioned reads derive strictly from
  per-version blobs excluding tombstones. Worth one confirmatory e2e of the old repro before formal
  closure.
- The entire **S4c-a / a2 / a3 soleauth-precondition** block (epoch fence, boot-window, flip-gating,
  delete forward-wire epoch, etc.) — the soleauth machinery was removed in #824.
- **`-race` test-harness race** (`per_version_backfill_walker_test.go` vs `RunApplyLoop`) — DONE-IN-EFFECT:
  the backfill walker + its test were deleted in #822.
- **Versioned tag/ACL RMW holds the meta-RMW lock across a raft propose** — moot: versioned
  `writeQuorumMeta` is raft-free for versioning-enabled buckets.
