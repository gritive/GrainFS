## Follow-ups

- **[EPIC] Retroactive EC-redundancy upgrade for NON-LATEST versions (versioning-enabled buckets).**
  The shipped sweep (v0.0.608.0) upgrades non-redundant (1+0) genesis objects but is **latest-version
  only**. Old non-latest 1+0 versions in a versioning-enabled cluster that started single-node stay
  non-redundant. A full prototype was built and reverted because it is **runtime-fragile (flaky ~50%
  in e2e)** — it needs robustness work that is its own epic, not a sweep tweak. Everything learned:

  **Architecture (why it is hard).** A per-version metadata record (`obj:{bucket}/{key}/{versionID}`)
  lives in the SINGLE group `groupIDForObject(bucket,key)` selects **at the generation the version was
  written**. On cluster growth a new placement generation is recorded with a larger candidate set, so
  the same key hashes to a different group — a genesis (pre-growth) version's record sits in the
  ORIGINAL (typically single-peer) generation group, while newer versions live in the current owning
  group. The versioned read (`probeRead` → `RouteObjectReadGenerations`, newest-generation-first) walks
  generations and resolves the version from whichever group holds it.

  **Why in-place relocation does NOT work.** The genesis group is single-peer (only the genesis node);
  its raft FSM — and thus the record — dies when that node is lost, no matter how redundant the DATA
  is. So the record must be MIGRATED to a multi-peer group, not rewritten in place.

  **The design that is functionally correct (code-gate SHIP, but flaky):** run on the newest-generation
  owning group's leader; read the version authoritatively (forwards); if no redundant copy exists,
  re-encode + commit a copy to the newest-gen (multi-peer) group with `PreserveLatest` (so the latest
  pointer never moves); then PURGE the stale copy from the older-generation group(s) via a forwarded
  `CmdDeleteObjectVersion`, so the version ends with exactly one record in a node-loss-surviving group.
  Add `(Key,VersionID)` dedup to `fanOutListObjectVersions` (cross-group LIST) for the migration window.
  Add a non-latest-specific relocated counter (`grainfs_ec_redundancy_upgrade_nonlatest_relocated_total`)
  so the e2e can wait on the SPECIFIC migration (the shared total mixes latest + non-latest).

  **Why it was reverted — runtime fragility.** The migration has fragile preconditions that do not hold
  reliably in a freshly-grown multi-group cluster: (1) only the newest-gen owning group's LEADER runs
  it (leadership churns during/after growth); (2) the cross-group version enumeration
  (`coordinator.ListObjectVersions`) is FAIL-CLOSED — one slow/unreachable group fails the whole list,
  so the candidate is invisible that cycle; (3) generation/gen-0 capture timing. Net: latest-path e2e
  is **2/2 deterministic**; non-latest e2e is **~50% flaky** (and worse under host load). Making it
  robust needs: a TOLERANT cross-group enumeration for the sweep (skip a failed group, retry, don't
  fail-closed), leader-agnostic or convergence-guaranteed migration driving, and a deterministic
  per-version readiness signal.

  **Orthogonal pre-existing bug to fix alongside (Q5).** `DeleteObjectVersion` routes via
  `RouteObjectRead`/`currentGroupIDs()` = newest-generation ONLY (no generation walk), so a user delete
  of a *pre-migration* old version misses its resident (older-gen) record and is a no-op today. The
  migration makes old-version deletes start working (the record moves to the newest-gen group), but a
  proper fix routes `DeleteObjectVersion` via the generation walk like `probeRead`.

  Scope: this is genuinely a multi-group per-version-record consistency subsystem, not a sweep tweak.
  Common deployments (versioning disabled, or form-then-write / `--bootstrap-expect-nodes`) are
  unaffected — this gap is "single-node start + versioning enabled + old non-latest 1+0 versions" only.
